- **`index.css`**: The external CSS file responsible for the overall styling and layout of the portfolio.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file, providing an overview of the project and setup instructions.

## Features

- **Header**: Displays the site title and navigation links for easy access to different sections.
- **About Section**: A concise introduction highlighting my background and professional interests.
- **Skills Section**: A detailed list of my technical and professional skills.
- **Projects & Achievements Section**: Showcases selected projects and notable accomplishments.
